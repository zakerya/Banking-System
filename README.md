## Overview
This console application simulates core banking operations:
- Create an account with a generated 7-digit account number and a PIN.
- Display all saved accounts from a data file.
- Deposit and withdraw money.
- Check balance after verifying account number and PIN.
- Delete an account.
- All account data is stored persistently in a file named `bank.dat`.

## Features
- **Create Account**: Auto-generated account number, user PIN, name, and starting balance.
- **Display Accounts**: Tabular view of account number, name, and balance.
- **Deposit Money**: Increase balance (currently in-memory; see [Limitations](#limitations)).
- **Withdraw Money**: Decrease balance with insufficient-funds protection (in-memory; see [Limitations](#limitations)).
- **Check Balance**: Requires correct account number and PIN.
- **Delete Account**: Removes account data.
- **File-Based Storage**: Uses `bank.dat` for persistence across runs.

## Project Structure
```
.
├─ main.c           # Source code (Bank Management System)
├─ bank.dat         # Data file created at runtime (account records)
└─ README.md        # Project documentation (this file)
```
**Note**: `bank.dat` is created/updated by the program in the current working directory.

## Data Format
Each line in `bank.dat` represents one account, using pipe-delimited fields:

```
AccountNumber|PIN|Name|Currency|Balance
```

**Field meanings**:
- **AccountNumber**: 7-digit integer generated by the app.
- **PIN**: Integer entered by user (stored in plaintext; see [Security Notes](#security-notes)).
- **Name**: Full name (spaces allowed).
- **Currency**: Single character, e.g., `$`.
- **Balance**: Floating value with 2 decimals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows
- GCC (MinGW) or MSVC toolchain
- Basic familiarity with a terminal/command prompt

## Usage Guide
After launching the program, you’ll see a menu:
1. Create Account
2. Display Account(s)
3. Deposit Money
4. Withdraw Money
5. Check Balance
6. Delete Account
7. Exit

- **Create Account**: Generates an account number, asks for PIN and Name, saves the record to `bank.dat`.
- **Display Account(s)**: Shows a formatted list of accounts with balances.
- **Deposit/Withdraw**: Prompts for amount and updates the in-memory balance.
- **Check Balance**: Requires correct Account Number and PIN.
- **Delete Account**: Verifies credentials and removes the account data.
- **Exit**: Closes the application.

## Security Notes
- PINs are stored in plaintext within `bank.dat`. For production or graded projects emphasizing security, use hashing (e.g., SHA-256) before writing to disk.
- The project is a learning example and not intended for real banking use.
